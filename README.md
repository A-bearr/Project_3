# Project_3



Global Financial Olympics: A gamified leaderboard where countries compete economically—akin to an Olympic medal count—based on top-performing companies.

We transform complex financial data into a global competition, assigning Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings to countries based on the number of top companies they have across metrics such as:
Revenue
Earnings
Market Capitalization
Dividend Yield
Growth Rate

Visuals:
Choropleth map colored by total medal count
Medal podium graphics and animated bar chart races
Trend comparisons over time

Tools:
Python (Pandas, hvplot, Matplotlib)	Data wrangling, core visualizations
JavaScript (Plotly, Leaflet)	Interactive dashboards and maps
PostgreSQL	Company financial data storage
D3.js	Advanced data visualizations
